Known Bugs (more severe ones come first)
----------------------------------------
(none)


Wishlist
--------
    * Support for gpg2. Please send an email to <t-prot@tolot.escape.de>
if you want this feature in vanilla t-prot.
    * Now Quoted-printable and the lot in Subject, To and From header
fields is done by --sani, but UTF-8 is still out there.


Rejected issues
---------------
    * Improving heuristics for M$ style TOFU is way tricky. In the end,
it's just plain guessing what is newly added text and what is quoted,
in particular with most "modern" MUAs disgustingly trying to invent some
new way of (not machine-parseable, of course) quoting that makes guessing
even harder.

    * Block-align lines of text. Same problem as above: It's really hard
guesswork to figure out what is intentional formatting and what is just
user laziness. Patches solving this issue are greatly welcome, of course.

    * If you set mutt's display_filter to "tee foo" when viewing a pgp
signed message and attach the resulting file to a pgp signed message,
the result is confusion when displaying this new message with t-prot.

This sounds much like "garbage in, garbage out", so just keep in mind
that the whole idea behind t-prot using the display_filter thing is
that you can turn it off with just one key stroke. It is definitely not
t-prot's responsibility to make *everything* look good and readable.



	TODO LIST FOR T-PROT.SL
	=======================

Wishlist
--------
Known problems:
    * t-prot.sl interacts badly with some other macros using the
read_article_hook. We should at least document the What and Why. Anyone
with some more S-Lang experience volunteering for this? ;)
    * ESC-6/ESC-7 as described in t-prot.sl does not take effect on the
article currently displayed (just on those processed later on). It would
be nice to have an alternative taking effect immediately.


Please keep in mind that t-prot.sl is an *example* script (for you to get
an idea on how to integrate t-prot into other software), so these are
really low priority. However, patches in unified diff format are always
welcome.
