T-PROT -- TOFU protection
=========================

1. What the hell is TOFU?
   As the man page says:
   TOFU is an abbreviation which mixes German and English words; it expands
   to "text oben, full-quote unten" which means "text above  -  full  quote
   below"  and describes the style of so many users who let their mailer or
   newsreader quote everything of the previous message and  just  add  some
   text  at  the  top;  obviously  they  think that quoted text must not be
   changed at all.  This is quite annoying as it needlessly sends a lot  of
   data  even when it is not required. Some editing of messages is desired.

   Thank you!

2. What does the script do?
   It detects,  and when demanded  hides annoying parts in rfc5322 messages:
   TOFU, huge quoted blocks, signatures (especially when they are too long),
   excessive punctuation,  blocks of empty lines,  trailing spaces and tabs.
   For use inside of MTAs or MDAs it exits with appropriate libc exit codes,
   so annoying messages may be bounced easily.
   
3. For what can I use it?
   There are  several possibilities.  One is  to filter your email  or news 
   messages when  displaying them  in your User Agent.  Another is blocking
   annoying messages entirely from your system  -  using the script in some
   sendmail  (see the man page for an  example)  or procmail rule,  or even
   inside innd.

4. Give me some example!  What about  an example configuration  for the MUA 
   mutt(1), or the NUA slrn(1)?
   An example is included in the distribution.  Please see the man page for
   further details on the activated features.

5. And what about other User Agents?
   I just use mutt and slrn, but I will gladly accept configuration samples
   for other user agents. There are already examples for mailcap(1) and the
   Heirloom mailx (a.k.a. nail) in the contrib/ directory. The mutt example
   works with mutt-kz as well.

6. Where did the idea come from?
   Many thanks  to  Gerhard H. Wrodnigg  who uses a  TOFU protection script 
   in order to keep  the responses to his cancel bot reasonably short.  The
   entire inspiration for this hack came from the "TOFU protection" line of
   his script on many usenet postings.
